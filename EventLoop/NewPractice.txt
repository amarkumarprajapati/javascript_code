give some for loop dsa questions
Sure! Here are some for loop DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) questions for you to practice:

1. Print all the elements of an array
Problem: Given an array, write a for loop to print all its elements.

2. Sum of all elements in an array
Problem: Given an array of integers, write a for loop to calculate the sum of all elements in the array.

3. Find the maximum element in an array
Problem: Given an array of integers, write a for loop to find the maximum element in the array.

4. Reverse an array
Problem: Given an array, write a for loop to reverse the array.

5. Count the occurrences of an element in an array
Problem: Given an array and an element, write a for loop to count the occurrences of that element in the array.

6. Check if an array is sorted
Problem: Given an array, write a for loop to check if the array is sorted in ascending order.

7. Print all even and odd numbers in an array
Problem: Given an array of integers, write a for loop to separate and print all even and odd numbers in the array.

8. Find the second largest element in an array
Problem: Given an array of integers, write a for loop to find the second largest element in the array.

9. Calculate the factorial of a number
Problem: Given a number, write a for loop to calculate its factorial.

10. Merge two sorted arrays
Problem: Given two sorted arrays, write a for loop to merge them into a single sorted array.

These questions should help you practice your for loop skills and strengthen your understanding of data structures and algorithms. If you need help with any specific problem or want more challenges, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
